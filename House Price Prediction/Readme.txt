# House Price Prediction

## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house based on various features such as location, size, and other attributes. Accurate house price predictions can be valuable for real estate agents, buyers, and sellers.

## Dataset
