# Email Spam Filtering Model

## Introduction
Email spam filtering is a technique used to automatically identify and categorize unwanted or unsolicited emails, commonly known as spam, from legitimate and relevant emails in a user's inbox. The goal of email spam filtering is to reduce the clutter in users' email accounts, enhance security by minimizing the risk of phishing and malware attacks, and improve the overall email experience.

This project utilizes the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which consists of 5,574 SMS messages in English, tagged as either 'ham' (legitimate) or 'spam'. Using this dataset, we build a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which is publicly available and widely used for spam detection research. The dataset contains:
- 5,574 SMS messages
- Tags indicating whether each message is 'ham' (legitimate) or 'spam'
